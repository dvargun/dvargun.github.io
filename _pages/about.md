I am a postdoctoral research associate in [the Department of Computational Applied Mathematics & Operations Research at Rice University](https://cmor.rice.edu/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I earned my Ph.D. in computational mathematics from Clemson University in 2023.​

My research focuses on numerical analysis, iterative methods for solving systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), finite element methods (FEM), data assimilation techniques, and numerical methods for applications in complex fluid and plasma dynamics and biomedical systems. I am passionate about conducting rigorous mathematical analysis of numerical methods, exploring the physical interpretations of PDEs, and validating these insights through comprehensive computational experiments.​
