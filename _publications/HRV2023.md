excerpt: 'We enhance Picard and Newton solvers for the Navier–Stokes equations by incorporating measurement data through continuous data assimilation (CDA) nudging. We prove CDA-Picard converges faster than standard Picard and remains contractive at higher Reynolds numbers, with both benefits increasing as more data is used. For CDA-Newton, we show the convergence basin expands in both initial guess and Reynolds number as data density grows. We also show CDA can be implemented by directly enforcing measurements, and benchmarks confirm the theory.'
