We couple KORC and NIMROD to simulate post-disruption runaway electrons with robust particle-to-mesh mapping. We validate deposition, resolve near-axis accuracy needs, and introduce a low-cost orbit-averaging method that reduces mesh-induced statistical noise—laying groundwork for future self-consistent coupling.
