excerpt: We couple KORC and NIMROD to simulate post-disruption runaway electrons with robust particle-to-mesh mapping. We validate deposition, resolve near-axis accuracy needs, and introduce a low-cost orbit-averaging method that reduces mesh-induced statistical noise—laying groundwork for future self-consistent coupling.

We develop a new procedure that combines the kinetic orbit runaway electron code (KORC) and the NIMROD extended-magnetohydrodynamic code to simulate runaway electrons (REs) in the post-disruption plateau. KORC integrates guiding-center orbits, with a barycentric-based binary search strategy providing initial guesses for the Newton–Raphson logical-to-physical coordinate inversion, ensuring reliable particle-to-mesh mapping in NIMROD, whose fields remain static for the present study. Samples are drawn in accord with experimental parallel current profiles of RE beams during the plateau phase. Deposition in NIMROD is verified through comparison with a Python-based finite-element code that ensures periodicity in the poloidal direction and continuity at the magnetic axis. Accurate representation of near-axis fields requires finer mesh resolution to prevent under- and overshoots in current density from orbit inaccuracies. Yet, at a fixed particle count, increasing mesh resolution amplifies statistical noise in the deposited fields. An orbit-averaging method accumulates partial current deposits over multiple kinetic steps and reduces the statistical noise with little added computational cost. By coupling kinetic routines from KORC directly into the NIMROD codebase, these developments lay essential groundwork for future self-consistent KORC–NIMROD coupling.
