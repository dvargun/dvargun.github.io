excerpt: 'We couple KORC and NIMROD to model runaway electrons in the post-disruption plateau. A barycentric binary-search initializer makes the Newton coordinate inversion robust, enabling reliable particle-to-mesh mapping with experimentally guided RE current sampling. We validate current deposition, show near-axis accuracy needs finer meshes, and identify the tradeoff that finer meshes increase statistical noise at fixed particle count. An efficient orbit-averaging scheme reduces this noise with minimal cost. These advances set the stage for future self-consistent KORC–NIMROD coupling.'
