title: "An efficient splitting iteration for a CDA-accelerated solver for incompressible flow problems"
collection: publications
category: books
permalink: /publication/FRV2025
excerpt: 'We present CDA-IPY, a faster, more reliable solver for steady incompressible flows that leverages partial (possibly noisy) data. CDA reduces nonlinear iterations, while Incremental Picard–Yosida splitting lowers the cost of each linear solve by requiring only one preconditioner per iteration. The combined method enables convergence at higher Reynolds numbers without tailored initial guesses and provides strong initial seeds for faster Newton solvers. We preserve convergence by adding stabilization to control splitting error and prove the resulting speed-up under appropriate parameter choices.'
