This article studies a finite element discretization of the regularized Bingham equations that describe viscoplastic flow. An efficient nonlinear solver for the discrete model is then proposed and analyzed. The solver is based on Anderson acceleration (AA) applied to a Picard iteration, and we show accelerated convergence of the method by applying AA theory (recently developed by the authors) to the iteration, after showing sufficient smoothness properties of the associated fixed point operator. Numerical tests of spatial convergence are provided, as are results of the model for 2D and 3D driven cavity simulations. For each numerical test, the proposed nonlinear solver is also tested and shown to be very effective and robust with respect to the regularization parameter as it goes to zero.
